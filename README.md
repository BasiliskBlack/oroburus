# Oroburus v0.7: Dual-File Self-Mutating Python

Developed by Micah Blake Langford and Co-Developer AI (Grok, xAI)

Oroburus is an experimental "anti-Python" system where a base Python script evolves through mutations defined in a separate Oroburus file. Watch your code transform from simple to super!

## How It Works
- `base_script.py`: A standard Python script with a `greet` function.
- `base_script_mutate.orb`: An Oroburus script that redefines `greet` and adds state with `cycle`.
- `run_dual.py`: Runs the base script, applies the mutation, and doubles back for an enhanced run.

## Try It
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BasiliskBlack/oroburus.git
   cd oroburus
